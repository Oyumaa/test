Unfortunately, the need for help is growing every day. Right now, 60 million refugees have been forced from their homes as a result of war and conflict, more people than at any time since World War II. In just the past few weeks, the world has seen hundreds of thousands more people displaced. Half of the refugees are children\xe2\x80\xa6and all of them struggle daily with hunger.\n\nThe ad we\xe2\x80\x99ve created and its message about war and hunger will be shared on television and in digital placements in nearly 40 countries around the globe as we invite people to donate to the World Food Programme. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll share it with your friends and make a needed contribution so that those displaced can get the help they desperately need.  \n \nYou can watch the ad below or here http://McD.to/peaceday\n \nThank you, Steve - McDonald's CEO""",b'Stop Hunger.
